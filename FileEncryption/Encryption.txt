ÝXJòóÕµˆPMÂ‘’î÷e you're encountering, System.UnauthorizedAccessException: 'Access to the path 'c:\encrypted.key' is denied.', indicates that your application doesn't have permission to write to the specified path. This is likely because writing directly to the root directory of the C drive requires elevated privileges.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

Change the Output Path: Instead of trying to write directly to c:\encrypted.key, consider writing to a location within the user's directory where your application has write permissions. You could use something like Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments to get a suitable directory.

Run as Administrator: You can run Visual Studio as administrator which would give your application the necessary permissions to write to the root directory. Right-click on Visual Studio shortcut and choose "Run as administrator".

Adjust Permissions: You could adjust the permissions of the directory C:\ to allow write access for the user running the application, but this is generally not recommended as it poses security risks.

Here's an example of how you might modify your code to use the user's documents directory:

csharp
Copy code
private void btnEncrypt_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    //Create a filestream that opens the path of the text file
    using (FileStream fsOut = File.Open(txtFile.Text, FileMode.Open))
    {
        // uses the TripleDES encryption
        using (TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider tdes = new TripleDESCryptoServiceProvider())
        {
            //links data streams to cryptographic transformations of the text file.
            using (CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(fsOut, tdes.CreateEncryptor(), CryptoStreamMode.Write))
            {
                // instantiate a StreamWriter to write on the textfile
                using (StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(cs))
                {
                    //write content of the text file
                    sw.WriteLine("Encrypted");
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Get the user's documents directory
    string documentsPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments);
    string keyFilePath = Path.Combine(documentsPath, "encrypted.key");

    //create a key to as a registry entry
    using (FileStream fsKeyOut = File.Create(keyFilePath))
    {
        //create a binary writer to a stream that supports writing strings in a specific encoding.
        using (BinaryWriter bw = new BinaryWriter(fsKeyOut))
        {
            //write the key using BinaryWriter
            bw.Write(tdes.Key);
            bw.Write(tdes.IV);
        }
    }
}
This code will write the encrypted key file to the user's documents directory, where your application should have appropriate permissions to write without encountering an access denied error.
