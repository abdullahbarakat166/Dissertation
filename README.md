This is project Addresses  AES encryption gaps for smart home devices and implementing an AES algorithm that mitigates cryptographic attacks. It focuses on Key managenet :
1. Key Generation
2. Key Distribution
3. Key Storage
4. Key Rotation.

The program is developed using c++ and C# programming Language
